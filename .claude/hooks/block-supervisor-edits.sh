# delegating to workers. This hook makes it mechanically impossible.

# Allows exceptions for non-code files the supervisor legitimately edits:
#   .cmux/*, MEMORY.md, reflection files, journal entries
#
# Receives JSON on stdin: {tool_name, tool_input, ...}
# Exit 0 = allow, Exit 2 + stderr = block with message
