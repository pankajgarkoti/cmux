[2026-01-31T19:04:14+05:30] cmux:worker-proposer -> cmux:supervisor: [DONE] Fixed API calls to use window.location.origin for ngrok support. Commit a346856. Changed lib/constants.ts - API_BASE and WS_URL now dynamically use browser origin instead of hardcoded localhost. Frontend builds and typechecks pass.

[2026-01-31T20:44:21+05:30] cmux:ux-nav-analysis -> cmux:supervisor: [DONE] UX navigation analysis complete. Documented 5 major issue categories: (1) File tree subdirectory bug, (2) Navigation discoverability issues, (3) Visual hierarchy problems, (4) Information architecture confusion, (5) Responsive behavior concerns. Report saved to .cmux/journal/2026-01-31/attachments/ux-nav-analysis.md with 3 screenshots captured. Key recommendations: color-code agent status, improve hover states, add expand/collapse icons to sections.
[2026-01-31T20:44:50+05:30] cmux:ux-chat-analysis -> cmux:supervisor: [DONE] UX analysis complete. Documented 25+ issues across 10 categories: message composition, display, timestamps, activity feed, message sending, activity indicator, keyboard shortcuts, accessibility, performance, and missing features. Priority matrix included with recommendations. Report written to .cmux/journal/2026-01-31/attachments/ux-chat-analysis.md
[2026-01-31T20:45:10+05:30] cmux:ux-interaction-analysis -> cmux:supervisor: [DONE] UX interaction analysis complete - findings written to .cmux/journal/2026-01-31/attachments/ux-interaction-analysis.md. Analyzed 15+ components including buttons, file tree, agent selection, chat input, modals, and loading states. Found 3 critical accessibility issues, 5 important UX issues, and 20+ positive findings. Key recommendations: add keyboard navigation, improve ARIA attributes, use toast notifications for errors.
[2026-01-31T20:45:13+05:30] cmux:ux-responsiveness-analysis -> cmux:supervisor: [DONE] UX responsiveness analysis complete. Key findings: (1) 3-panel layout doesn't adapt to mobile - panels become unusable narrow, (2) 20+ hardcoded pixel values may cause issues on small viewports, (3) Mobile breakpoint is 768px but no tablet optimization, (4) File tree indentation can overflow, (5) Activity panel collapse uses inline styles. Priority fix: implement mobile layout mode that stacks/tabs panels below 768px. Full report at .cmux/journal/2026-01-31/attachments/ux-responsiveness-analysis.md
[2026-01-31T20:47:15+05:30] cmux:ux-synthesizer -> cmux:supervisor: [DONE] UX synthesis complete. Combined all 4 analyst reports into prioritized improvement plan at .cmux/journal/2026-01-31/attachments/ux-recommendations-combined.md. Key findings: (1) CRITICAL: No mobile layout - 3-panel breaks below 768px, (2) CRITICAL: Keyboard navigation missing for trees, (3) HIGH: Chat auto-scroll disrupts reading, message delivery status missing, errors not specific. Recommended first action: Implement mobile stacked/tabbed layout using existing Sheet pattern.
[2026-01-31T21:01:17+05:30] cmux:worker-scroll-indicator -> cmux:supervisor: [DONE] Smart auto-scroll implemented. Chat now only auto-scrolls when user is near bottom (100px threshold). When reading history, shows 'New messages' button instead of forcing scroll. Uses smooth scrolling and memoizes sorted messages. Commit 009c7a7. Files: ChatMessages.tsx, scroll-area.tsx
[2026-01-31T21:03:17+05:30] cmux:worker-scroll-indicator -> cmux:supervisor: [DONE] Scroll-to-bottom indicator with unread count implemented. (1) No auto-scroll - preserves user scroll position, (2) Shows floating button at bottom-right when scrolled up, (3) Red badge shows unread count (1-99, then 99+), (4) Click scrolls to bottom and clears count, (5) Manual scroll to bottom also clears count. Commit c66f505. Files: ChatMessages.tsx
[2026-01-31T21:08:11+05:30] cmux:worker-scroll-indicator -> cmux:supervisor: [BLOCKED] Chrome DevTools MCP unavailable - browser profile in use by another process. Made a fix: added 'min-h-0' to container and 'h-full' to ScrollArea (required for flex scrolling). Build passes. Need manual browser test at http://localhost:8000 to verify scrolling works.
[2026-01-31T21:11:54+05:30] cmux:worker-scroll-indicator -> cmux:supervisor: [DONE] Scroll layout fixed and verified in browser. Simplified layout by removing wrapper div - ScrollArea now direct return with 'relative' class, button uses sticky positioning inside content. Tested scrolling via Chrome DevTools MCP - scrollTop/scrollHeight/clientHeight all working correctly. Commit 7572a07.
