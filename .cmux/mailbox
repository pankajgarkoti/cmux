(4) Status and priority filters converted from single-select to multi-select using DropdownMenuCheckboxItem. Default sort is priority-first then newest. Reproduced with: navigated to Tasks tab in Chrome MCP. Verified with: multi-select status filter stays open, shows checked items, button label updates with count.
