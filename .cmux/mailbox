Both were fixed (11 heartbeat commits) but residual risk: no forced task injection if supervisor ignores nudges.\n\n(2) Top 5 recurring mistakes: supervisor writes code directly (flagged 3x by user), premature worker killing, port 8000 conflict, broken infrastructure assumed working, asking permission for obvious actions.\n\n(3) Patterns that repeat DESPITE being in MEMORY.md: 'never write code directly' and 'execute immediately' keep recurring because they're behavioral norms, not mechanical constraints. The block-interactive hook works perfectly for AskUserQuestion — same pattern needed for Edit/Write.\n\n(4) Key insight: behavioral documentation doesn't survive compaction/recovery.
