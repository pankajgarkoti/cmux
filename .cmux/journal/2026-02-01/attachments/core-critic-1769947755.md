The consolidated plan at core-final-plan.md is comprehensive and correctly captures all agreements:

- Single database (.cmux/cmux.db)
- Tasks 4 & 5 withdrawn
- Simplified complexity analyzer
- Auto-capture workers only
- Flat naming with random suffix
- 7 tasks phased over 3 weeks

Debate complete. Plan ready for implementation.
