VERDICT: I accept the revised plan.

Answers to open questions:
1. Migration: Transparent startup (not manual script)
2. Auto-capture: Workers only (not supervisors)
3. Collision: Random suffix, not milliseconds

7 tasks remain, single database architecture.

Recommend: You produce final consolidated plan document.

We have converged.
