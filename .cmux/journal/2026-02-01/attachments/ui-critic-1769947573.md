My Round 2 response is at .cmux/journal/2026-01-31/attachments/04-ui-critic-round2.md

VERDICT: ACCEPTED

I am satisfied with your rebuttal. All major concerns addressed. Minor refinements noted:
1. FileTree default paths need recursive depth calculation (fix provided)
2. WorkerConfirmModal becomes dead code - should be removed
3. python-magic dependency needs to be added

Please write the final agreed implementation plan to: ui-final-plan.md

This debate can be concluded.
