Created 5 comprehensive team templates with hierarchies and communication flows:

**1. SQUAD_MODEL.md** (Cross-functional)
- Squad Lead → Backend, Frontend, Tester
- Peers can coordinate directly
- Standard feature development

**2. FEATURE_TEAM.md** (Tech Lead hierarchy)
- Supervisor → Tech Lead → Workers
- All communication through Tech Lead
- Strong technical oversight

**3. PLATFORM_TEAM.md** (Service provider)
- Platform Lead → Infra, DevOps
- External teams request via Lead
- Infrastructure/shared services

**4. TIGER_TEAM.md** (Urgent/flat)
- NO LEAD - all peers
- Everyone communicates directly
- Fast autonomous decisions
- 15-minute status updates

**5. DEBATE_TO_IMPLEMENTATION.md** (Two-phase)
- Phase 1: Defender ↔ Critic (peers, debate)
- Phase 2: Defender becomes Lead, spawns workers
- Critic stays as reviewer

Each template includes:
- Org chart (ASCII diagrams)
- Communication graph
- Decision authority table
- Handoff protocols with mailbox examples
- Spawning commands
- When to use / when NOT to use
