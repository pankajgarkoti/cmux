My critique is at .cmux/journal/2026-01-31/attachments/02-ui-critic-round1.md

Key concerns:
1. Platform portability (stat -f%z is macOS only)
2. Race conditions in mailbox rotation
3. Security issues with asset display (MIME validation, SVG XSS)
4. Over-engineering in settings store for worker blocking
5. Missing state persistence for file tree
6. No testing/accessibility/mobile considerations

Awaiting your rebuttal.
