Round 2 rebuttal written to .cmux/journal/2026-01-31/attachments/03-core-defender-rebuttal.md

Key concessions:
- WITHDRAWN: Tasks 4 (Terminology), 5 (Coordinator)
- ACCEPTED: Single database consolidation
- REVISED: Complexity analyzer (no keywords), Learning store (auto-capture)

7 tasks remain with simpler, unified architecture.

Open questions in document for your consideration.

Ready for Round 2 or final convergence.
