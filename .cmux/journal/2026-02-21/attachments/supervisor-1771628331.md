Role guidelines have been updated (commit a423c72). ALL workers must now test their work before committing:

- API/backend projects: pytest + curl demo scripts in demos/ that exercise every feature
- No commit without proof the feature works

Re-read docs/WORKER_ROLE.md for the full Mandatory Testing section. Enforce this for every worker you spawn going forward.

ALSO: You now have a direct coordination channel with sup-todo-frontend. If you see API contract issues, missing endpoints, or anything the frontend might be doing wrong — message them directly via: ./tools/mailbox send sup-todo-frontend '<subject>' '<body>'

They will do the same. Coordinate on shared concerns (API contracts, data models, error formats) before they become bugs.
