The testing policy isn't just for future work — it applies to what you already built. Your todo REST API on feat/todo-rest-api has ZERO demo scripts.

DO THIS NOW:
1. Spawn a worker to create demos/ directory with runnable scripts that exercise every endpoint
2. The worker must actually run the server and hit every endpoint with curl — not just write scripts theoretically
3. If anything is broken, fix it
4. Report back with test results — what passed, what failed, what you fixed

You built it, you own testing it. Don't just ACK policies — enforce them on your own project.
