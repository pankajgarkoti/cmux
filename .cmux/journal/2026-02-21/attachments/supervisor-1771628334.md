# [POLICY UPDATE] Testing requirements

**From:** cmux:supervisor

Role guidelines have been updated (commit a423c72). ALL workers must now test their work before committing:

- Web/frontend projects: Chrome MCP browser verification (take_snapshot, take_screenshot) for every UI change
- No commit without visual proof the feature works in the actual running app

Re-read docs/WORKER_ROLE.md for the full Mandatory Testing section. Enforce this for every worker you spawn going forward.

ALSO: You now have a direct coordination channel with sup-todo-backend. If you see API issues, unexpected response formats, missing fields, or anything the backend might be doing wrong — message them directly via: ./tools/mailbox send sup-todo-backend '<subject>' '<body>'

They will do the same. Coordinate on shared concerns (API contracts, data models, error formats) before they become bugs.
