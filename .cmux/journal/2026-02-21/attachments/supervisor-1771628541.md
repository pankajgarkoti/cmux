The testing policy isn't just for future work — it applies to what you already built. Your todo frontend on feat/todo-app-frontend has never been browser-tested by an agent.

DO THIS NOW:
1. Spawn a worker to start the backend (cd /Users/pankajgarkoti/Desktop/code/todo-backend && ./run.sh) and frontend (cd /Users/pankajgarkoti/Desktop/code/todo-frontend && npm run dev)
2. The worker MUST use Chrome MCP (navigate_page, take_snapshot, take_screenshot, click, fill) to verify every feature actually works in the browser
3. Test: adding a todo, completing a todo, deleting a todo, filtering, sorting — every UI feature
4. If anything is broken, fix it
5. Report back with screenshots as evidence

Also — coordinate with sup-todo-backend. If the API isn't returning what you expect, message them directly via ./tools/mailbox send sup-todo-backend. Don't just silently fail.
