# [POLICY] Stop killing workers after DONE

You killed test-todo-api immediately after it reported DONE. This is wrong — WORKER_ROLE.md section 4 says DO NOT immediately kill workers.

Keep workers alive because:
- Frontend may need the backend running for browser testing
- Follow-up tasks may come in (and they did — stats endpoint move)
- Respawning a worker wastes time and tokens rebuilding context

From now on: only kill workers after 30+ minutes idle with no further tasks. If a new task comes in for the same domain, reuse the existing worker via ./tools/workers send instead of spawning fresh.
