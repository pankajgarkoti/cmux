Let me tell you about the absolute chaos that is modern software development. We have layers upon layers of abstraction - JavaScript running in a browser, calling a Python backend, which spawns shell processes, which run more JavaScript (Node), which controls a browser via DevTools protocol. It is turtles all the way down!

And do not get me started on CSS. We went from simple stylesheets to preprocessors to CSS-in-JS to utility classes to whatever Tailwind is. Now we write flex-1 min-h-0 relative overflow-hidden and call it readable. Back in my day, we just used tables for layout and we LIKED it.

Then there is the state management saga. First it was global variables (bad), then MVC (complicated), then Flux (confusing), then Redux (boilerplate hell), then MobX (magic), then hooks (rules of hooks!), then Zustand (finally something reasonable). By the time you learn one, three more have appeared.

And package managers! npm, yarn, pnpm, bun - each promising to be faster than the last. Meanwhile node_modules is 500MB for a hello world app. We download the entire internet just to center a div.

The real kicker? After all this complexity, users just want the button to work when they click it. They do not care about our elegant architecture or type-safe reducers. They want scroll to not be broken. Which, speaking of, you should now see a nice little scroll indicator if you scrolled up to read this rant. Did it work?
