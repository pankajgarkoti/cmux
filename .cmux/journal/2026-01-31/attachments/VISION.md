# CMUX Vision

If you used this for two years and it worked, you'd have something deeply personal. Customized exactly to how you work. Connected to your tools, your APIs, your habits. Holding two years of memories about what you built together.

That's the goal.

## The Vision

A system that:
- Remembers everything you built together
- Connects to your tools and grows new integrations when you ask
- Can argue with itself to make better decisions
- Lives in a git repo you own forever
- Becomes more useful the longer you use it

After two years, it's not a tool anymore. It's a collaborator shaped entirely by your work.

## How We Got Here

A conversation that clarified what this project is actually trying to be.

---

**Model:** I reviewed the auth plan. It's pragmatic, well-structured.

**Pankaj:** I didn't write that. The system wrote it. I told it to stage a debate — a critic versus an advocate — and they argued until they agreed on something simpler.

---

**Model:** So it already improves itself through internal argument.

**Pankaj:** Yes. And I built half the current interface by asking it to add features to itself.

---

**Model:** Where does this lead? What's the bigger picture?

**Pankaj:** Think about it this way. What if, from the very beginning of ChatGPT, you could have asked it to add things to itself? Search, integrations, memory — anything. And it would just write the code and become that.

---

**Model:** Like asking it to add WhatsApp, and it reads the Twilio docs and wires it up.

**Pankaj:** Exactly. Or a scheduler. Or a research module that runs at 3am. The point is it's not a fixed product. It grows.

---

**Model:** But isn't there a risk? If it modifies itself, it might drift away from what you actually want.

**Pankaj:** It's not autonomous yet. I still have to trigger everything. But the vision is to give it a heartbeat. A tick every ten minutes. Let it wake up, see what needs doing, and act on its own.

---

**Model:** So the model itself is just... processing power?

**Pankaj:** Right. The friend isn't the model. The friend is the system. The files. The memories. The integrations it built. Swap Claude for GPT or Llama — the friend survives because it lives in the repo.

---

**Model:** Git as the persistence layer. Push to backup. Pull to resurrect.

**Pankaj:** If I use this for two years, I don't want to lose that. Clone it to a new laptop and everything is still there. What we worked on, how it learned to help me, the tools it added.

---

**Model:** What about security? It has access to API keys, environment variables.

**Pankaj:** Not a priority. If I want something intelligent, I have to give it freedom. Prompt injection could nuke me. That's a risk I accept. It shouldn't stop me from building something cool.

---

**Model:** What about scaling to a hundred agents?

**Pankaj:** We'll get there. But that's not the point. The point is extensibility. Ask it to rewrite its own router when Bash gets too slow. Ask it to add a database. It just does it.

---

**Model:** So after two years...

**Pankaj:** After two years, you have something no one else has. Shaped by your work. Holding your memories. Connected to your world.
