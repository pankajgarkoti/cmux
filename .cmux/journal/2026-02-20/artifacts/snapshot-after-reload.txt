Commit 343913c on feat/meta-campaign-events contains all implementation:
Event 2: Cashfree first ₹199 charge → Meta CAPI (webhook-processor.ts)
Event 3: Saniya 10-message milestone → Meta CAPI (meta-capi.ts, route.ts, atomic SQL migration)
TypeScript compiles clean (no new errors)
Completion was reported to sup-heroweb via mailbox before compaction
Not pushed (per task instructions)
No pending work. Awaiting further instructions from the supervisor or user.

This was sent out of the blue. I am assuming it is a response to the heartbeat, but we just fixed the UI, so it should show up as that, right? Do you need a server restart?"

The thing is, these supervisors that were supposed to execute in Hero and Hero Web did not trigger independent code review workers. They just did not. They should have; it's in the process, and if it's not in the process, add it.

Also, did you look at the issue of these supervisors actually just being agents that have worker semantics? These aren't actually acting like supervisors for some reason.
