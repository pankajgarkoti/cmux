Q1: No manual steps/config/dashboard needed - setUserID is pure client SDK call, Meta SDK already init at app mount. Q2: Crash-safe - TS string type prevents null, all 6 callsites pass Supabase UUIDs, try-catch wrapper catches runtime errors, SDK init runs before login flow. Q3: No other deps - 3 files, 30 insertions, self-contained. Commit 30b077d is clean.
