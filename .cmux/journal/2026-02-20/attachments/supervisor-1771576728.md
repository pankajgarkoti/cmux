The user noticed you committed a Supabase migration file (supabase/migrations/20260220000000_atomic_increment_messages.sql) with an RPC function. But this migration can't run automatically — it needs to be manually applied via Supabase dashboard or CLI.

Please verify:
1. Is the SQL migration file the ONLY thing that needs manual Supabase action? Or are there other DB changes needed?
2. Did you test that the TypeScript code calling the RPC (incrementMessageCount in app-user-profiles.ts) will gracefully handle the case where the RPC function doesn't exist yet?
3. Are there ANY other changes in your commit that require manual steps or external dependencies beyond just deploying the code?
4. List exactly what the user needs to do manually before this feature works in production.

Report back ASAP.
