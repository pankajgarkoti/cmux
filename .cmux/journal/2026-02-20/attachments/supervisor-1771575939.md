Implement the Meta campaign events changes from the debate plan. Work on a NEW FEATURE BRANCH (e.g. feat/meta-campaign-events).

SCOPE FOR HERO (mobile app):
Only the prerequisite — Step 0 from the final plan:

1. lib/meta-analytics.ts — Add setMetaUserId() function that calls AppEventsLogger.setUserID()
2. stores/user-store.ts — Call setMetaUserId(id) inside the setUserId() action (the chokepoint where all login paths converge)
3. lib/meta-analytics.web.ts — Add no-op stub for setMetaUserId

Event 1 (INR 1 Trial): NO changes — existing logPaymentDone() already covers it.
Events 2 and 3: Server-side only, handled by heroweb team. Not your scope.

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Create and checkout a feature branch first (git checkout -b feat/meta-campaign-events)
- Spawn a worker to implement the changes
- Run typecheck/lint after changes
- Commit with descriptive message
- Do NOT push — just commit locally
