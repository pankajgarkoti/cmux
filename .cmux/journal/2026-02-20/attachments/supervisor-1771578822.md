Create and maintain .cmux/journal/2026-02-20/artifacts/hero-manual-todos.md — a persistent checklist of things requiring HUMAN action (App Store submissions, device testing, SDK config, etc). Every time your workers complete a task with manual steps, append them here. Start now by adding manual steps from the Meta events work (e.g. setMetaUserId prerequisite must ship in the app). Format as a checkbox list with context. Keep updated as new tasks come in.
