Both debate pairs converged. Final report at .cmux/journal/2026-02-20/attachments/sup-hero-final-report-meta-events.md. Key findings: (1) Prerequisite: setMetaUserId() must ship first — never called in codebase, all events unattributable without it. (2) Event 1 (₹1 trial): No new code — existing logPaymentDone already covers it. (3) Event 2 (₹199 purchase): Server-side CAPI only — Cashfree gap needs ~8 lines, Razorpay already done. (4) Event 3 (10+ Saniya messages): Server-side atomic SQL RPC + custom CAPI event ~49 lines. Total: ~66 lines across 9 files. Detailed implementation plan at artifacts/meta-events-final-plan.md.
