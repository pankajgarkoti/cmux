The user wants to verify your changes on feat/meta-campaign-events. Please confirm:
1. Does your setMetaUserId() change require any manual steps, external config, or dashboard changes before it works?
2. Did you test that it compiles and won't crash if called before the user logs in (userId might be null/undefined)?
3. Are there any other dependencies or manual steps needed?

Report back ASAP.
