Two of three fixes landed:
- Commit 6e11d97: Duplicate events fixed (verified in Chrome)
- Commit 5f8e1af: Thoughts tab now shows actual reasoning, not tool call events (verified in Chrome)
- Worker-persist-thoughts spawned: Thoughts ARE already stored in SQLite — the frontend just never fetches them from the API on load. Fix in progress to add historical thought loading so they survive page refresh.
Will alert when the persistence fix lands.
