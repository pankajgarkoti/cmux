Critic accepted all revisions. Key outcomes: (1) Step 0 prerequisite: add setMetaUserId to hero mobile app. (2) Event 1 (₹1 trial): no new event needed — existing logPaymentDone suffices once attribution is fixed. (3) Event 2 (₹199): server-side CAPI only in heroweb webhook-processor.ts. (4) Event 3 (10+ messages): server-side atomic SQL RPC with custom Meta event name. NOTE: Events 2+3 are backend changes in heroweb, not RN app changes.
