You need to find the best places in the heroweb (web frontend) codebase to fire 3 new Meta tracking events for campaign optimization. The app already sends Meta events — these are 3 NEW specific ones:\n\n1. **INR 1 Trial Start** — fired when user starts the ₹1 trial\n2. **INR 199 Purchase Complete** — fired when user completes the ₹199 purchase\n3. **10+ messages sent to Saniya** — fired when a user has sent 10 or more messages to the AI character Saniya\n\nUSE THE DEBATE SYSTEM: Spawn a debate pair (defender + critic) to analyze the codebase and debate the optimal placement for each event. They should examine existing Meta event firing patterns, payment/purchase flows, message sending logic, and propose exact file locations and code insertion points. Save the final recommendation as an artifact. Read docs/templates/teams/DEBATE_PAIR.md for the template.
