Create and maintain .cmux/journal/2026-02-20/artifacts/heroweb-manual-todos.md — a persistent checklist of things requiring HUMAN action (Supabase migrations, Vercel env vars, DNS config, third-party dashboards, etc). Every time your workers complete a task with manual steps, append them here. Start now with the Meta events manual steps: (1) Run SQL migration on Supabase for increment_message_count() RPC, (2) Verify META_APP_ID and META_APP_SECRET in Vercel, (3) Hero mobile prerequisite — setUserID must ship first. Format as checkbox list with context. Keep updated.
